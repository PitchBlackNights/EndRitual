# Bundle Theology
Combine all music discs into one "bundle" (Custom item that just looks like all the discs together).
With this bundle you can throw it into soul fire. It will then rise and explode.
This will drop an End Portal Frame that can be mined. This Portal Frame will also teleport to the player's inventory when dropped or picked up.
(If inventory is full, go to Enderchest. If Enderchest is full, go to an interdimensional storage pocket that the player can retrieve items from.)
